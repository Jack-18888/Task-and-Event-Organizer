Here's a draft `README.md` for your **personal organizer frontend** project. It reflects its current development stage and feature set:

# 📆 Personal Organizer (Frontend)

This is a React-based personal organizer web application designed to help users manage their **tasks**, **calendar events**, and **profile**, all within a responsive and secure interface. The backend is assumed to be running locally (default: `http://localhost:5000`).

The corresponding server is located at https://github.com/Jack-18888/Task-and-Event-Organizer-Server

## 🚧 Project Status
